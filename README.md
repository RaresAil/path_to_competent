# Path to Competent

![CI/CD Testing](https://github.com/RaresAil/path_to_competent/workflows/CI/CD%20Testing/badge.svg)

## Why CI/CD Testing?

The reason for CI/CD testing is to run the tests on node versions 10, 12 and 14 to check if all the tests are compatible and with older version of node.

The function `Object.fromEntries` was not in node v10 so i had to Polyfill that function, the polyfilled function can be found [Here](polyfill/fromEntries.js)

## List with the tests:

1. Currying & Function Composition
2. Immuttability
3. Map Class & Reduce Function
4. Pure Functions
5. Symbol
6. Polyfilling
7. High Order Functions
8. Classes & Prototype
9. Event Loop & Threads
10. Arrow Functions & this
11. Coercion
12. Transpiling & Regex
